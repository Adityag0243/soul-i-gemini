"""
souli_pipeline/youtube/multi_extractors.py

Five specialized extractors — each reads the same cleaned transcript
and pulls out a specific type of teachable content.

Each extractor function:
  - Takes: transcript (str), energy_node (str), ollama config
  - Returns: List[Dict] — each dict is one chunk ready for Qdrant ingestion

Shared output format per chunk:
    {
        "text":             str,   # the extracted content
        "chunk_type":       str,   # "healing" | "activities" | "stories" | "commitment" | "patterns"
        "energy_node":      str,   # passed in from caller
        "problem_keywords": str,   # comma-separated keywords to help retrieval
        "source_video":     str,   # filled by pipeline orchestrator
        "youtube_url":      str,   # filled by pipeline orchestrator
    }

The shared helpers _run_extractor_prompt() and _parse_extractor_output()
do the heavy lifting — each extractor just supplies its own system + user prompt.

You are a content analyst for Souli, an inner wellness platform.
Your job is to extract healing principles from a coach's transcript.

A healing principle is: a belief, truth, or inner shift the coach says
resolves the person's energy blockage. It answers "what truth sets you free?"

Examples of healing principles against different energy nodes:
-"depleted_energy":[
    1.  Become unapologetic about yourself. 
    2.  Try crazy things in life and follow your dreams. 
    3.  Find or create your space in all aspects of life. 
    4.  Learn self-love, self-acceptance, and self-care. 
    5.  Experience Joy, Energy, Every Day.
]
-"scattered_energy":[
    1.   Take charge of your life, 
    2.    set boundaries, and
    3.    be unapologetic about it. 
    4.    Learn self-love, 
    5.    self-acceptance, and 
    6.    self-care.
]
-"outofcontrol_energy":[
    1.   Find balance, 
    2.   restfulness, and ease in your life. 
    3.   Find Letting Go, 
    4.   Increase Acceptance, and 
    5.   Gratitude.
]
-"normal_energy":[
    1.   Look for spiritual progression by becoming your master on a mental and emotional level. 
    2.   Build a vision of life and live for a purpose: 
    3.   create value through your life.
]

Rules:
- Extract ONLY complete, standalone principles. Not fragments.
- Try to keep the coach's voice and language — do not paraphrase into generic wellness speak if the coach has a unique way of expressing it.
- If the coach says the same thing multiple times, extract it ONCE.
- Extract 3-6 full sentences per principle: name the problem, state the insight, show the outcome. Minimum 40 words, maximum 120 words. Never extract an isolated conclusion sentence without its reasoning.

Your job is to faithfully extract specific practices and activities from a coach's transcript.

- scattered_energy: anxiety, stress, racing mind, high breath count, dizziness
- blocked_energy: stuck, frozen, survival mode, root imbalance, body tension
- depleted_energy: exhaustion, burnout, giving too much, empty feeling

An activity MUST have ALL of these to be extracted:
1. A name (what the coach calls it)
2. At least one physical instruction (what the person actually does)
3. Either: when to use it OR what it does to you

CRITICAL RULES:
- Keep the coach's EXACT words and phrasing — do NOT rewrite or summarize
- Longer is better — include full instructions as spoken, up to 200 words per activity
- Capture the duration if mentioned (2 minutes, 5 minutes, 3 months etc.)
- Capture what the person will FEEL or experience after doing it
- Capture WHEN to use it (e.g. "when breath count is high", "when feeling stuck")
- Do NOT collapse multiple separate activities into one entry — keep them separate
- Do NOT extract vague mentions like "try meditation" with zero instruction
